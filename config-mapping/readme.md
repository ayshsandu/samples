Mappings to old .xml configs to .toml


For those who are familiar with WSO2 products, in prior versions, there are multiple configuration files such as carbon.xml, identity.xml, application-authenticators.xml.

But in WSO2 Identity Server 5.9.0, we have introduced a new configuration model where the majority of the configurations are now managed via a single file. 

In this folder you can find, mappings from .xml to deployment.toml.
